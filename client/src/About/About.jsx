      <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div className="content">
    <p>-----<span>GYM</span> and Fitness, we believe that fitness and wellbeing are the cornerstones of a full and vibrant life. Established in 2002, we began our journey as a family-owned business dedicated to providing exceptional gym equipment at affordable prices. But, we dreamed bigger than just being an ordinary fitness equipment supplier; we aspired to lead the industry.
<br/>
Two decades later, we are proud to have transformed Gym and Fitness into one of Australia's premier online retailers of fitness equipment. We've moved beyond <br/>just supplying gear â€“ we've become advocates for fitness, wellbeing and life enrichment. Our commitment to excellence is reflected not only in the quality equipment we provide but also in the lives we've improved.</p>
